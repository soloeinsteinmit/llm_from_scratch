# intro to LLMs

1. What is a Large Language Model (LLM)

- An LLMs are an **neural networks** designed to `understand`, `generate` and `respond` to human like text
- Deep neural network trained on massive amount of text data

2. Why LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL(LLMs)?

- `LARGE`: models have billions of parameters
- `LANGUAGE MODELS`: these models do a wide range of NLP task: question, answering, translation, sentiment analysis and much more!

3. LLMs vs Earlier NLP Models

- LLMs can do wide range of NLP tasks
- NLP was designed for specific task like language translations etc...
- Earlier language models could not write an email from custome instructions, a task that is trivial for modern LLM

4. What makes LLMs so good? Secret sauce?

- the secret is `Transformer Architecture`
- Generative AI is LLM + DL: using deep neural network to create new content such as text, images, various forms of media
- LLMs represents a specific application of deep learning techniques leverating their ability to process and generate human like text

5. Application of LLMs

- Content creation
- Sentiment analysis
- novel text generation
- machine translation
- chatbots, virtual assistants
